# Harbor
[harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor) is a free and open source private container registry. Harbor is a CNCF graduated project that allows you to setup a private artifact registry with features like vulnerability scanning, RBAC, SSO, and more.

This is my installation of harbor for my homelab, allowing me to host my own private artifact registry and avoid the expenses of a cloud based registry. It was also a very fun experience to setup my own registry at home.
